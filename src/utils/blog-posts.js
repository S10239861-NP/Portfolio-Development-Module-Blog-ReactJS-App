          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            During this week's PFD lesson, I was briefed about the teaching plan
            and overall schedule for this module and the lecturer made an
            announcement regarding who the module representative for this module
            would be.

            <img src={DesignThinkingIllustration} alt="image" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, during this week, I learnt about what design thinking
            is and how it can be utilized to approach a problem in a
            user-oriented manner and design solutions that are better catered
            for the needs and preferences of the end user.
          </p>

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the concepts pertaining to design thinking that I learnt
            about during this week's OAL was the 5 stages in the design thinking
            process, which are:
          </p>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Empathizing
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  Empathizing refers to researching and understanding the needs
                  of the end users. A problem cannot be solved until one is able
                  to understand it first.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Defining
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  Defining involves stating the the needs of the end users, as
                  well as the problems at hand.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Ideating
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  Ideating involves challenging one's assumptions and coming up
                  with ideas.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Prototyping
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  At the prototyping stage, one starts to create solutions to
                  the aforementioned problems that address the identified needs
                  of the end users.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Testing
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  Testing involves trying out the solutions that were created
                  during the prototyping stage. It is important for one to test
                  their solutions so as to ensure that their solutions do not
                  yield any incorrect or unintended outcomes.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

              caption="The benefits of design thinking."
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Another concept pertaining to design thinking that I learnt about
            during this week's OAL was the benefits that design thinking offers
            to businesses who use this problem-solving methodology, some of
            these benefits include:
          </p>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Allowing businesses to create solutions that more effectively
              cater to the needs of their customers, thus resulting in increased
              customer satisfaction and increased customer retention.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Aiding businesses in creating and developing innovative solutions
              that offer them a competitive advantage over other businesses.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>
            How I can apply what I have learnt during this week's OAL to the PFD
            project
          </h3>
          <p>
            I can make use of the 5 stages of design thinking to formulate a
            more structured and organized plan that our team can follow that
            will enable them to come up with an effective solution to our
            selected problem statement within a reasonably short period of time.
          </p>
          <h2>Project Development</h2>
          <p>
            <img src={GroupBrainstormingIllustration} alt="image" />
          </p>
          <p>
            This week, my teammates and I were more focused on the empathizing,
            defining and ideating stages of design thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            We agreed upon each taking some time to research and do whatever it
            took to understand our selected problem statement and the needs of
            the end users as much as possible, as well as to brainstorm possible
            solutions to the problem statement based on the information that we
            had obtained from our research and gradually nurtured understanding
            of the problem statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, I was able to increase my understanding of my team's
            selected problem statement, however, I am still stuck on identifing
            the needs of the end users, as well as possible solutions to the
            aforementioned problem statement.

                  Design thinking is needed because it can help us to tackle

                  way that prioritizes the needs of the people that will be
                  impacted by it, in other words, the end users.

          <p>
            This week, my teammates and I finally managed to come to an
            agreement regarding the solution that we would be developing as part
            of our PFD project to address our selected problem statement.
          </p>
          <h3>The idea for our PFD project that my team settled on</h3>
          <p>
            <img src={AndroidDevelopment} alt="image" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea that we agreed upon was that we would develop an Android
            application called &quot;Kato&quot; to address our selected problem
            statement which has to do with helping Workato enhance their
            onboarding process for new hires and new employees.
          </p>
          <h3>Keynotes from my team's meeting with the mentors from Workato</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              As long as the solution addresses the problem statement, the
              specific platform(s) that the solution would be available on
              should not be too much of an issue.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              However, it would be preferable for the solution to be available
              particularly on mobile platforms (i.e. Android, iOS) as it would
              be a lot more convenient to use since mobile devices are typically
              more portable compared to other devices such as computers,
              additionally, many people tend to own at least 1 mobile device
              nowadays.

          <h2>OAL Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            During this week's OAL, I had learnt about various concepts ranging
            from system diagrams and architecture diagram creation tools to
            design patterns and methods to design software architectures. Here
            are some of the key takeaways and key concepts that I learnt about
            during this week's OAL:
          </p>
          <h3>System Diagrams</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              They show how computer systems connect together.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Computer systems need components that do the following:
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <CaptionedImage
              src={SystemDiagramsSS1}
              alt="image"
              caption="A sample diagram showing the various components of a system."
            />
          </p>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Here is an example of a system diagram for the security system of
              a data centre:
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

              caption="A system diagram for the security system of a data centre."
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Free Architecture Diagram Software</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">Draw.io</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Design Patterns</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">Creational</li>
            <li className="li-1">Structural</li>
            <li className="li-1">Behavioural</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Creational Design Patterns</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">Singleton</li>
            <li className="li-1">Prototype</li>
            <li className="li-1">Builder</li>
            <li className="li-1">Factory</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Structural Design Patterns</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">Facade</li>
            <li className="li-1">Proxy</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of Behavioural Design Patterns</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">Iterator</li>
            <li className="li-1">Observer</li>
            <li className="li-1">Mediator</li>
            <li className="li-1">State</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Singleton Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              A singleton is a type of object that can only be created once.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Prototype Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              It is an alternative way to implement inheritance (class
              inheritance), as inheritance can sometimes lead to a complex
              hierarchy of code.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Instead of inheriting functionality from a class, the
              functionality comes from an object that has already been created.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Results in a flat prototype chain that makes it much easier to
              share functionality between objects especially in a dynamic
              language like Javascript (which supports prototypal inheritance
              out of the box).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Builder Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Instead of creating the object and setting its properties in its
              constructor method, we instead create the object and set its
              properties step-by-step by using other methods.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              It is also possible to delegate the building logic to another
              class.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Factory Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Instead of creating an object using the “new” keyword (such as in
              languages like C#, Java and Javascript), we use a function or
              method to create the object.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Facade Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              It is basically a simplified API to hide other low-level details
              in one's code base.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Proxy Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Despite its name, it refers to a substitute.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              An example of this design pattern being applied is the Reactivity
              system in the Vue.js framework.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">In the framework, one can create data.</li>
            <li className="li-1">
              However, the framework itself needs a way to intercept that data
              and update the UI whenever that data changes.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              The way Vue.js handles this is by replacing the original object
              with a proxy, which takes the original object as the 1st argument
              to its constructor method and takes a handler as the 2nd argument
              to its constructor method.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Inside the aforementioned handler, one can override methods such
              as the “get” method and “set” method to run code whenever a
              property on the object is accessed or modified.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This allows developers using the framework to work with the proxy
              just like they would with a regular object, with the relevant
              handlers being triggered whenever they access or change a property
              (provided that the property in question has a handler that gets
              executed when it is accessed or modified).
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This design pattern is commonly used when one has a very large
              object that might be expensive to duplicate in memory.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Iterator Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Allows one to traverse through a collection of objects.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              An example of this design pattern being applied is the for-loop
              which is present in many modern programming languages such as C,
              C++, C# and Javascript.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              With iteration, one starts with a collection and then writes code
              to determine how to get from the start to the end.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">It is a pull-based system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Observer Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">It is a push-based system.</li>
            <li className="li-1">
              It allows many objects to subscribe to events that are broadcast
              by another object.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">It is a one-to-many relationship.</li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This design pattern is commonly used in application development.
              An example of this design pattern being used is in Firebase, when
              one's data changes on the server, all of the client applications
              that are subscribed to it are automatically updated with the
              latest data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Mediator Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              The mediator is similar to a middleman or a broker.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Provides a centralised point for coordination and communication
              for many objects, thus preventing a messy and potentially
              ineffective many-to-many relationship.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              An example of this design pattern being used is in the Express.js
              framework, where there is a middleware system.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Middleware sits in the middle of incoming requests and outgoing
              responses by intercepting every request and transforming it into
              the proper format for the response.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This design pattern provides separation of concerns and prevents
              code duplication.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The State Design Pattern</h3>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              In this design pattern, an object behaves differently based on a
              finite number of states.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This design pattern allows one to start with a base class and then
              provide it with different functionality based on its internal
              state.

              The idea behind this design pattern is related to finite state
              machines and libraries like XState, where the goal is to make an
              object's behaviour predictable based on its underlying state.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              A way of implementing this design pattern is by creating a
              separate class for each possible state of an object and each of
              these classes will contain an identical method that behaves
              differently. Inside the class of the object that these states
              belong to, one sets the state as a property and whenever a method
              belonging to the state is called, we delegate it to the object's
              current state.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              This allows the object to behave in a different way whenever its
              state changes, while making it such that one does not need to
              change the API or use a bunch of conditional logic (such as
              if-statements or switch statements which do not scale so well).

              An architectural pattern is defined as a general and reusable
              solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture
              within a given context.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Layered Pattern (also known as the N-Tier architecture)
              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  Known to be the most commonly used pattern.
                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  Used to build general desktop applications and simple web
                  applications.
                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  Tends to perform poorly in high-performance applications due
                  to the inefficiency of going through multiple layers to fulfil
                  a request.
                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  Good for situations with a very tight budget and time

                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  The following layers are usually present:
                  <ul className="ul-1">
                    <li className="li-1">Presentation Layer</li>

              <ul className="ul-1">
                <li className="li-1">
                  In this pattern, a single event triggers a series of
                  processing steps, with each of these steps performing a
                  specific function.
                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  Divides a large processing task into a sequence of smaller and
                  independent processing steps or filters that are connected by
                  channels/pipes.
                </li>
                <li className="li-1">
                  Often used in compilers, where the filters perform tasks such
                  as lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code
                  generation.

                <li className="li-1">
                  The titles that you come up with should provide the audience a

                <li className="li-1">

            the PFD project, with one of the main reasons for the changes being
            due to certain suggestions and recommendations we had received from
            the mentors from Workato during our meeting with them this week.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This week, my teammates and I pitched our newly developed solution,
            which came in the form of a web application, to the stakeholders at
            Workato.
          </p>
          <h3>Presentation of our solution at the Workato headquarters</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the schedule for the third day of the Workato hackathon,
            my teammates and I had to present the first prototype for our
            solution to the stakeholders at the Workato headquarters in
            Singapore, with one of the stakeholders being one of our team's
            mentors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to our scheduled presentation, I was quite nervous as I was
            not sure as to how the stakeholders would react or respond to the
            solution we would be presenting to them on that day.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make things worse, there were a few small features and parts of
            the implementation with regards to our solution which had not been
            fully completed yet, one of them included the embedded Discord
            chatbot feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, the next couple of minutes or so prior to the
            presentation was pretty much a race against time as I hurriedly
            attempted to complete the implementation of the incomplete features
            of our web application. I also had to patch a few bugs that popped
            up during the development phase which had unfortunately not been
            patched before the day of our presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, I was able to patch the remaining bugs and partially
            implement the Discord chatbot feature just before the presentation,
            though unfortunately for the team, the embedded Discord chatbot
            feature was not exactly ready to be presented yet and so as a
            result, we decided to briefly cover that feature of the website
            during our presentation instead of going into more detail about it
            and demonstrating it to the stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that being said, here are some pictures taken during our team's
            presentation. Although there were certain flaws in our presentation,
            I am still glad that it went smoothly and well.

          <h2>OAL Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            There was no OAL for this week due to the fact that during this
            week, each of the teams for the PFD project would be presenting
            their solutions to the stakeholders. The three-day long Hackathon
            was also held during this week, which took up a sizeable chunk of
            the week.

            During this week, my teammates and I worked around the clock to
            complete the implementation of our selected features for the Kato
            web application. We ended up running into several frustrating
            front-end related bugs during the process of creating the website
            and designing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was initially expecting the back-end portion of the website to
            take longer to implement than the front-end portion of the website,
            however, to my surprise, the opposite happened instead and one of my
            teammates and I, who were responsible for implementing and handling
            the front-end portion on the website, ended up spending a lot more
            time on the front-end portion than expected. If my memory serves me
            correctly, I believe that we spent more than 3 or 4 days working on
            the front-end part of the website while I had only needed slightly
            less than a weekend to implement the back-end portion of the
            website, though to be fair, it was not extremely complicated to do
            so.

                My teammates and I came to an agreement on the type of database
                that we would be using for the solution that we were developing,
                we agreed to use an SQLite database which the web application
                could store information in and retrieve information from by
                sending requests to the backend server.

                the web application, as we did not have access to enough
                real-world data to use for testing at the time.

            Due to the New Year holiday just happening to fall on the Monday of
            this week, which also happened to be the first day of the year 2024,
            there was no PFD lesson held on Monday itself, however, there was a
            lesson conducted on the Friday of the same week around noon. The
            lesson essentially served as a consultation session for each of the
            PFD teams, including my team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, due to certain unforeseen circumstances, some of my
            teammates and I were unable to make it in time for the consultation
            session, instead, we all only managed to arrive at the venue when
            the consultation session had basically ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, we decided to go to a different classroom and discuss
            about the PFD project, some of the matters that were discussed
            during this brief meeting included the plan for delivering the
            remaining features that we had agreed to include as part of our
            solution as well as how to evenly and efficiently split the workload
            between each of the members in our team.

          <p>
            During this week, there was no OAL, however, my teammates and I
            utilized the additional time to continue working on our PFD project
            in preparation for the upcoming Project Showcase event.

          <p>
            During this week, my teammates and I mainly focused on brainstorming
            and coming up with ideas pertaining to the new features that we
            could add to the solution to allow it to more effectively address
            our selected problem statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also conducted some more research regarding the problem statement
            as I believed that having a deeper understanding of the problem that
            we were trying to solve might also help me come up with more ideas
            regarding new features that could be added to the solution to
            increase its effectiveness in addressing our selected problem
            statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I looked around the Internet for appealing visual
            elements and UI designs that we could incorporate into our solution
            to enhance its visual appeal to the end users.

            This week, we had a PFD lesson on Monday in the afternoon, this
            lesson served as another consultation session that my team could
            make use of, as well as an opportunity for the lecturer to inspect
            our progress on the development of our solution for the PFD project.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the lecturer came over to my team to check up on our progress
            on the PFD project, he brought up certain points which I feel can be
            of use to us in terms of helping us to better understand the steps
            we need to take to further enhance and improve our solution. Several
            of these points were mainly directed towards the design of the Kato
            web application and include:

          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">

          <p>
            Based on the discussions that our team had throughout the course of
            this week, I then compiled a list of tasks that we could add to the

            of this week to work on our PFD project so as to prepare for the
            upcoming Project Showcase event.

            This week, one of my teammates and I focused on adding new features
            and improving the user interface design and responsiveness of our
            web application while another teammate focused on fully implementing
            their Discord bot, both of which were part of our solution for our
            selected problem statement.

            There was no OAL for this week, however, my teammates and I made use
            of this week to work on our PFD project so as to prepare to showcase
            it to our lecturer.

          <p>
            During the course of this week, I mainly focused on the frontend of
            the web application, mainly working towards implementing new
            features, patching existing or newly discovered bugs, and attempting
            to improve the responsiveness of the web application so that it
            would be both viewable and usable on devices with smaller screens
            (i.e. mobile phones and tablets).
          </p>
          <p>
            The various tasks that I completed during this time included but
            were not limited to the following:
          </p>
          <ul className="ul-1">
            <li className="li-1">
              Created a low-fidelity wireframe for the revamped
              &quot;Dashboard&quot; page, which has now been renamed to the
              &quot;Home&quot; page.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Created a custom HTML element for the sidebar, this was done to
              minimize code duplication and ensure that the functionality,
              visual appearance, and responsiveness of the sidebar was
              consistent across each of the different web pages.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Refactored code for various HTML files and CSS files to remove
              redundant code and patch several visual bugs which included
              elements in certain webpages not appearing at their correct
              positions.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Decided on which information should be displayed on the &quot;Know
              your team&quot; page for each of the end user's
              teammates/colleagues.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Fixed an issue involving the charts on the home page being
              displayed at incorrect positions.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Finished setting up a bundler for the web application project, I
              decided that it might be best to use a bundler such as Vite to
              simplify the process of importing and exporting functionality from
              various JS files that the web application relied on.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Came up with a new schema for the database that the web
              application would be fetching data from.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Planned out the schema and overall structure for each of the
              tables in the aforementioned database.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Inserted mock data into the database that would be used for both
              testing and demonstrational purposes.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Removed the &quot;Trainings&quot; option from the sidebar
              displayed in the web application.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Finished implementing the functionality for the &quot;Know your
              team&quot; page of the web application.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Finished implementing the functionality for the &quot;Home&quot;
              page of the web application.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Patched a visual bug involving the sidebar not being displayed
              correctly in the web application.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Implemented dynamic data retrieval and data visualization for the
              &quot;Know your team&quot; page of the web application.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Implemented a feature that would allow the browser to cache the
              end user's staff ID (only while they are logged in to their
              account).
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Conducted the final tests to ensure that the Kato web application
              was responsive and usable on both devices with larger screens
              (i.e. computers) and devices with smaller screens (i.e. mobile
              phones and tablets).
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Liaised with the other members of my team to estimate progress
              towards the completion of each component of the project (i.e. the
              Kato web application and the Kato Discord chatbot) and allocated
              tasks to each of them accordingly.
            </li>
            <li className="li-1">
              Patched several backend-related bugs which were in turn leading to
              several other issues in the web application (i.e. issues that were
              preventing end users from logging in to their account, viewing
              certain information, performing certain actions, and viewing
              certain webpages and content).
            </li>
